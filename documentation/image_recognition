Goal: To read text from screen and feed into model

A: Raw screen reading using OpenCV
	Req strong transforms
		Color negative, smoothing, greyscale

B: NN text recognition

C: Context based text reading


Process:
A Complete 
	Requires isolation and transformations

B: 2 parts
	Read image and determine regions that may contain text
	Run text reader on segements

Train NN to recognize 
	Check available libraries
	Transfer learning using existing and limited labeled set
